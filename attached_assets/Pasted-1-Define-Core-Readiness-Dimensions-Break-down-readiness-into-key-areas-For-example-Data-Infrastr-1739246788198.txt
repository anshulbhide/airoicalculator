1. Define Core Readiness Dimensions
Break down readiness into key areas. For example:

Data Infrastructure & Quality:
• Evaluate how well data is collected, stored, and made accessible.
• Questions: “Do you have a centralized data repository?” or “How clean and integrated is your customer data?”

Business Process Automation:
• Assess the extent of process digitization and automation already in place.
• Questions: “Which manual tasks would benefit from automation?” or “Do you have standardized workflows?”

Technology & IT Capabilities:
• Gauge the current tech stack, cloud adoption, and overall digital maturity.
• Questions: “What percentage of your processes are supported by digital tools?” or “Do you leverage APIs and modern integrations?”

Team Skillset & Culture:
• Measure digital literacy, openness to change, and availability of in-house expertise.
• Questions: “Do you have a dedicated IT/data team?” or “How comfortable is your team with new digital tools?”

Use Case & Value Proposition Identification:
• Identify where generative AI can have immediate impact (e.g., personalized marketing, customer service, content generation).
• Questions: “Are there repetitive tasks that could be automated?” or “Have you identified opportunities for personalized customer engagement?”

Budget & Investment Readiness:
• Understand if there’s appetite for innovation in terms of budget and strategic focus.
• Questions: “Have you allocated budget for digital transformation initiatives?” or “What percentage of revenue is reinvested into technology?”

Compliance & Risk Management:
• Consider any regulatory or security requirements that might impact AI adoption.
• Questions: “Are you subject to strict data privacy regulations?” or “Do you have protocols in place for data security?”

2. Interactive Assessment Flow
a. Welcome & Context Setting:

Begin with a short introduction that explains the benefits of Gen AI and why readiness matters.
Include a progress bar to show users where they are in the assessment.
b. Sectioned Questionnaire:

Divide questions into the core dimensions outlined above.
Use a mix of question types: multiple-choice, rating scales (1–5), and yes/no answers to gauge maturity.
Include tooltips or brief explanations for each question so users understand why each dimension is critical.
c. Scoring & Benchmarking:

Calculate a readiness score for each dimension and an overall composite score.
Compare the score against industry benchmarks or digital maturity scales (e.g., Not Ready, Partially Ready, Fully Ready).
Use visual cues such as gauges, heat maps, or scorecards to make the results immediately digestible.
d. Personalized Results & Recommendations:

Based on the scores, generate a tailored report outlining strengths and opportunities.
Offer actionable recommendations (e.g., “Invest in data consolidation”, “Upskill your team on AI tools”, or “Explore process automation in customer service”).
Optionally, include a “next steps” checklist or roadmap that the SMB can follow.
