1. Basic Company & Industry Context
1. Write 2-3 lines about your company and who your customers are. 
2. Industry/Sector
    * Dropdown (e.g. “Manufacturing,” “E-commerce/Retail,” “Healthcare,” “Finance,” “Education,” etc.)
3. Core Offerings or Business Model
    * Multiple choice (e.g. “Product Sales,” “Subscription Service,” “Consulting/Services,” “Marketplace/Platform,” etc.)
Purpose: Gives the AI a sense of domain needs and typical pain points (compliance, data, etc.). The 2-3 lines should be an open-ended text box.

        * “Reducing operational costs”
        * “Generating new revenue streams”
        * “Other (please specify)”  
Purpose: Helps home in on the relevant use-case category (e.g., chatbot for customer support vs. advanced analytics for cost reduction). The “Other” option should be an open-text field that sends the response to the LLM. 

3. Potential AI Use Cases
1. Which of these use cases are most appealing or relevant?
    * Multiple-select:
        * “Automated customer-service chatbots”
        * “Content or product recommendation”
        * “Document processing & summarization”
        * “Sales enablement (e.g., lead qualification, personalized outreach)”
        * “Intelligent analytics (e.g., demand forecasting)”
        * “HR & recruitment automation”
        * “Other (please specify)”
Purpose: Captures immediate interest areas that the AI recommendation engine can key into. The “Other” option should be an open-text field that sends the response to the LLM.

4. Data Availability & Quality
1. Which types of data do you have readily available?
    * Multiple-select:

        * “Somewhat organized, but multiple sources”
        * “Mostly unstructured or scattered across departments”
        * “Limited data or not sure”
Purpose: Helps assess feasibility and complexity of AI projects (retrieval-augmented generation, chatbot training, etc.).

5. Current Tech Stack & AI Maturity

    * Single-select:
        * “Yes, we have in-house AI/ML tools”
